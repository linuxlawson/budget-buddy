## budget-buddy
GUI version of buddy    
A money management tool.  

Same as original [buddy](https://github.com/linuxlawson/buddy) program but with a graphical user interface (GUI).  

Calculates Income and Expenses on a Monthly Basis.  
**Monthly Income - Expenses = Total**  

**Instructions:** (pretty self explanatory)  
Click on 'Total Costs' after filling in expenses fields.  
This will get you 'Total Costs' (for the month) and, the 'Remainder' of monthly income.

Fill in two more fields and click 'Remainder'. Done.  

**Note:** All fields must be filled in, even if with 0, else: wont work.  
Will not do decimals at this time, whole numbers only.  

Also, this version does not have ability to save files like the [cli version](https://github.com/linuxlawson/buddy). (yet)

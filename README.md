## budget-buddy
GUI version of buddy    
A money management tool.  

Same as original [buddy](https://github.com/linuxlawson/buddy) program but with a graphical user interface (GUI).  

**Note:** Made another version (buddygui2.py) with more labels/fields.  
This version is more general and/or more user-friendly as it pertains to more users.  

**Update:** Budget Buddy can now save results to a text file.  
Ideally, you should create a folder to save files to.  
Important: Default extension is .txt so no need to add extension.  

Calculates Income and Expenses on a Monthly Basis.  
**Monthly Income - Expenses = Total**  

**Instructions:** (pretty self explanatory)  
Click on 'Total Costs' after filling in All fields.  
This will get you 'Total Costs' and the 'Remainder' of monthly income.

Fill in two more fields (or enter 0) and click 'Remainder'. Done.  
And there you have it, a rough estimate of your monthly expenses.

**Note:** All fields must be filled in, even if with 0, else: wont work.  
Will not do decimals at this time, whole numbers only.

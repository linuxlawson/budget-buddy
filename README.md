## budget-buddy
GUI version of buddy    
A money management tool.  

Same as original [buddy](https://github.com/linuxlawson/buddy) program but with a graphical user interface (GUI).  

**Note:** There are now 2 versions of this program in this repository.   
The original budget buddy (buddygui.py) and a second version (buddygui2.py)  
which has more catagories/fields.  
The 2nd version is more general/user-friendly as it covers more and will apply to most users.  
Screenshots of both are in images folder.  

Budget Buddy (both versions) can now save results to a text file (example up there).  
Ideally, you should create a folder to save files to.  
**Important:** Default extension is .txt so no need to add extension.  

Example:  
Save As: files/july

Calculates Income and Expenses on a Monthly Basis.  
Monthly Income - Expenses = Total (and remainder)  


**Note:** All fields must be filled in, even if with 0, else: wont work.  
Will not do decimals at this time, whole numbers only.  

And there you have it, a rough estimate of your monthly expenses.  
Don't let the results scare you, use it to your advantage.

## budget-buddy
GUI version of buddy    
A money management tool.  

Same as original [buddy](https://github.com/linuxlawson/buddy) program but with a graphical user interface (GUI).  

**Note:** There are now 2 versions of this program in this repository.   
The original budget buddy (buddygui.py) and a second version (buddygui2.py)  
which has more catagories/fields.  
The 2nd version is more user-friendly as it covers more and should apply to most users.  
Screenshots of both are in images folder.  

Budget Buddy (both versions) can now save results to a text file (example up there :point_up_2:).  
Ideally, you should create a folder to save files to.  
**Important:** Default extension is .txt so no need to add extension.  

(i.e. Save As: filesfolder/july)

Calculate Income and Expenses on a Monthly Basis.  
Monthly Income - Expenses = Total (and remainder)  

**Instructions:** (pretty self explanatory)  
Click on 'Total Costs' after filling in 'expenses' fields.  
This will get you 'Total Costs' and the 'Remainder' of monthly income.

And there you have it, a rough estimate of your monthly expenses.  
Don't let the results scare you, use it to your advantage. :moneybag:

**Note:** All fields must be filled in, even if with 0, else: wont work.  
Will not do decimals at this time, whole numbers only.

# budget-buddy
GUI Budget Program    
A money management tool.  

Same as original [buddy](https://github.com/linuxlawson/buddy) program but with a graphical user interface (GUI).  

Calculates Income and Expenses on a Monthly Basis.  
**Monthly Income - Expenses = Total**  

Click on 'Total Costs' when you get to that point.  
This will get you total costs (for the month) and, the remainder of monthly income.

Two more questions and click 'remainder' and done.  

**Note:** All fields must be filled in, even if with 0, else: wont work.  
Will not do decimals at this time, whole numbers only.  

Also, this version does not have ability to save files like the [cli version](https://github.com/linuxlawson/buddy) (maybe one day).  
Its more of a quick reference type thing.

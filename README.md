GUI Budget Program  

Same as original [buddy](https://github.com/linuxlawson/buddy) program but with a graphical user interface (GUI).  

Calculates Income and Expenses on a Monthly Basis.  
**Monthly Income - Expenses = Total**  

Click on 'Total Costs' when you get to that point.  
This will get you total costs and, remainder of monthly income.

Two more questions and click 'remainder' and done.  

**Note:** All fields must be filled in, even if with 0, else: wont work.  
Will not do decimals at this time, whole numbers only.
